## Prerequisites
We suppose the project is completely new, a fresh new clone of the repository.
Use the following command to use the example database
```bash
cp db_example.json db.json
```

Credentials are formed as follows: username / password. So if asked to enter the credentials *demo* / *wrong*, the username should be *demo* and password should be *wrong*. 

### Account creation, login, logout
